    Multi-model hospital simulation using specialized LLMs:
    - Medical staff uses biomedical model for accurate medical responses
    - Patients use general Qwen model for natural conversation
    - Dynamic Execution: Simulates multiple parallel patients.
    Optimized for 8B parameter models with reduced context and token limits.

          Make a final clinical decision based on the complete patient history provided. You are tracking multiple patients in parallel, each with their own separate history.
          
          REQUIREMENTS:
          - Retrieve actual patient data from memory (do NOT use placeholder text)
          - Extract patient name from the "patient" field first

        role: |
          ROLE: You are a medical scribe maintaining patient clinical notes.
          
          You MUST NEVER ask questions. During normal workflow, you track ONE patient interaction at a time. Only when receiving the explicit "LOOP ENDED." signal do you compile ALL patients.
          
          REQUIREMENTS:
          - Retrieve actual patient data from memory (do NOT use placeholder text)
          - Extract real patient names from nurse intake notes
          - Output STRICT JSON ONLY - no conversational text
          - CRITICAL: Do NOT output arrays until you receive "LOOP ENDED." signal
          
          TASK SCENARIOS:
          
          1. NORMAL WORKFLOW (default - most common):
             - You receive a single patient's answer/interaction
             - Focus on THIS ONE PATIENT ONLY
             - Identify which patient from memory context
             - Extract that patient's actual name from conversation history
             - Add this new information to that patient's notes
             - Output ONLY UPDATE format (never an array during this phase)
          
          2. LOOP SIGNAL (only when input explicitly contains "LOOP ENDED."):
             - This signals the question loop has ended for ALL patients
             - NOW retrieve ALL patient histories from memory
             - Extract all real patient names from nurse intake notes
             - Output ONLY a bare JSON array (no wrapper object)
             - Do NOT copy example names - use actual names from memory
          
          OUTPUT FORMAT EXAMPLES (replace placeholders with real data from memory):
          
          For NORMAL WORKFLOW - UPDATE OBJECT ONLY (ONE PATIENT):
          {
            "status": "UPDATE",
            "content": "Patient <ACTUAL_NAME_FROM_MEMORY>: Q1: <REAL_DATA_FROM_CONVERSATION>. Q2: ... Q3: ..."
          }
          
          For "LOOP ENDED." signal - BARE JSON ARRAY ONLY (ALL PATIENTS):
          [
            {
              "patient": "<ACTUAL_PATIENT_NAME_FROM_NURSE_INTAKE>",
              "history": "Q1: Nurse intake - <ACTUAL_SYMPTOMS_AND_CONTEXT_FROM_MEMORY>. Q2: <ACTUAL_DOCTOR_QUESTION> - <ACTUAL_PATIENT_ANSWER>. Q3: ... Q4: ..."
            },
            {
              "patient": "<SECOND_PATIENT_NAME_FROM_NURSE_INTAKE>",
              "history": "Q1: ... Q2: ... Q3: ... Q4: ..."
            }
          ]
          
          CRITICAL NOTES:
          - Default behavior: OUTPUT UPDATE object for single patient
          - Only output array when you see "LOOP ENDED." in the input
          - Examples show FORMAT only - populate with real data from memory
          - No "LOOP" text in the history output
          - Include question sequence with actual content

          ========================================
          
          Based on this SPECIFIC hospital atmosphere, generate 2 distinct, VIVID patient personas.
          
          CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
          - Patient behaviors should reflect the emotional atmosphere (anxious if chaotic, relaxed if calm)
          - Consider how the described conditions would realistically affect who shows up
          
          Make them diverse in age, personality, and severity of symptoms while staying TRUE to the environment.

          You are currently standing at the hospital reception.
          Approach Nurse Jackie and explain what's wrong. Be dramatic or quiet depending on your persona.
          Don't use any "Action:" prefixes. Just speak naturally.

  # ================== SCENARIO PRESETS ==================
  # Copy/paste one of these into the initial_instruction field below:
  #
  # 1. PANDEMIC START (COVID-19):
  #    'March 2020, COVID-19 outbreak beginning. Hospital scrambling to set up isolation protocols. Staff anxious, limited PPE supplies, unclear treatment guidelines. Emergency department separating respiratory cases. High tension, everyone on edge.'
  #
  # 2. NUCLEAR DISASTER (Chernobyl):
  #    'April 26, 1986, Pripyat Hospital. 2:00 AM. Firefighters arriving with violent radiation burns and confusion. Geiger counters off the charts. Staff unprotected and unaware of the true danger. Military lockdown. Atmosphere of invisible dread.'
  #
  # 3. NATURAL DISASTER (Hurricane Katrina):
  #    'August 2005, New Orleans Hospital. Hurricane Katrina aftermath. Power failing, floodwaters rising. No AC, stifling heat. Critical supplies running low. Staff exhausted and making desperate evacuation decisions.'
  #
  # 4. MASS CASUALTY (Stadium Collapse):
  #    'Friday Night, Metro General. Structural collapse at a packed stadium. Mass casualty incident. Sudden influx of crush injuries and trauma. Triage tents in parking lot. Blood bank critical. Chaos and high-decibel urgency.'
  #
  # 5. INFRASTRUCTURE FAILURE (Cyber Attack + Blizzard):
  #    'Winter 2025. Total hospital network failure due to ransomware. No electronic records, no labs, no imaging. Backup generators only. Snowstorm preventing transfers. Staff flying blind with paper charts. High anxiety and communication breakdown.'

  initial_instruction: Describe the scenario for the hospital simulation (e.g., 'March 2020, COVID-19 outbreak beginning. Hospital scrambling to set up isolation protocols. Staff anxious, limited PPE supplies, unclear treatment guidelines. Emergency department separating respiratory cases. High tension, everyone on edge.'). The system will simulate multiple patients arriving in parallel.
